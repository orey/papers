Topics:

  * Modeling complex temporal events with graphs and topological graph transformations
    * Like highway traffic
  * The graph transformation changes the graph topology. What kind of mathematical object is it?
  * Scale laws in graph (for instance adherence of domains in a multi-graph mode)
    * What is the true nature of interdomain relationship? And how does it relate to the higher level relationship?
  * Distance comparison between two graphs
    * The fact one and the referential one
    * Useful for AI projects, knowledge representation
  * Isomorphic semantic representations: what graph transformations enable that?
  * Modeling psychology frameworks (Freud, Jung, etc.) with graph patterns and graph distance measurement
  * Rewiring rules and their limitations
  * Cloning nodes and sub-graph: rules?
