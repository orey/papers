# First article on graph-oriented programming

![Graph sample](../yed/graph01.png)

In 2013, I started a personal project around directed attributed graph databases. The objective was to find a programming model that would enable the software to be as "soft" as the database.

## First works

The concept was defined and setup during 2014 and 2015.

Two articles on graph transformations were a crucial inspiration to the project.

[The AGG Aproach](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Claudia_Ermel/publication/238626850_The_AGG_approach_language_and_environment/links/570cdd1708aec783ddcd98c7.pdf) published in the volume 2 of the "Handbook of Graph Grammars". AGG was particularly inspiring.

*Ermel, Claudia, Michael Rudolf, and Gabriele Taentzer. "The AGG approach: Language and environment." Handbook Of Graph Grammars And Computing By Graph Transformation: Volume 2: Applications, Languages and Tools. 1999. 551-603.*

Another article from the same book was also a source of inspiration, "The Progres approach" (which doesn't seem to be available online).

*Schürr, Andy, Andreas J. Winter, and Albert Zündorf. "The PROGRES approach: Language and environment." Handbook Of Graph Grammars And Computing By Graph Transformation: Volume 2: Applications, Languages and Tools. 1999. 487-550.*

Beginning of 2015, the graph-oriented programming concept was completed, and its capability of solving the useless technical debt was theoretically proven.

The graph transformations are playing a core role in graph-oriented programming.

## Closed-source prototype

In 2016, it was prototyped in a company called GraphApps in a closed source approach. I am no longer art of this company.

## Global article on graph-oriented programming

A very first article was written in 2016 to explain all the concepts of this programming model.

This article is far from being perfect and didactic but it browses a lot of topics that would deserve special attention (especially in the part concerning graph transformations).

The original article can be found here: [The graph-oriented programming paradigm](../pdf/20161026-TheGraphOrientedProgrammingParadigm-ORey-PreliminaryVersion.pdf).
