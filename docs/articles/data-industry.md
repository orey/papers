# Data challenges in the industry

![Data](../images/data.jpg) 

"Data is the new gold". "Data drives the world". "We are in a data driven world".

All medias, and not especially the IT medias, are obsessed with data and the value they represent. The fact is what is true for retail is not so obvious in a lot of other businesses such as the industry.

Maybe data is the new gold, but we are often like miners: in front of data that are really difficult to manipulate, especially when those data are representing objects that have a lifecycle, we need methods to deal with those data and make sense of them.

In the industry, where the "Digital Continuity" or "Digital Thread" are buzzwords, there are some fundamental problems with the data, problems that we will describe here trying to bring solutions.

## The real nature of data

Data is not absolute, it is the result of a set of parameters.

Data is the product of:

  * A semantic space,
  * A point of view,
  * A specific moment in time.
  
Data was always produced by a certain business process. Some data may be simple to interpret, for instance the list of articles you consulted in a retail website. With those data and the ones of people that bought the same products than you, you can create personalized recommendation algorithms.

But in the industry, that is not because you ave the data that you can use them.
