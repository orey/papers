# About End-To-End PLM

![gears](../images/engrenages.jpg)

This article is intended to be a description of the basic functions a PLM is supposed to provide, and of the basic logic a PLM is supposed to implement. As the industry is beginning to look towards IT a bit more seriously that what was done in the last decades, it may be important for IT people outside the industry:

* To understand what the PLM is all about;
* To have some perspective about the reasons why things are as they are;
* To have points of comparison with other kinds of systems that are met frequently outside of the industry (in the so-called "service" area).

I hope this article will manage to bring some light on those points.

_Warning_: Some points of views are the one of the author and may be not shared. I will try to highly the polemic statements in this article.

As time goes on, the product lifecycle management (PLM) area proposes more and more functionality, linked together, in platforms that tend to be bigger with time.

The increasing size of the PLM platforms is answering to a simplistic dream of users to have "everything linked together in the same place". In this article, we are going to analyze that dream that is, to our point of view, conveniently forgetting some of the most basic principles of large IT systems.

## The three business domains of the industry

An industrial company is generally architectured on 3 business domains:

* Engineering Office: Where the products are designed, and certified in some industries;
* Industry: Where the products are built;
* Support: Where the products are supported.

Those three domains, while working on the same data, have very distinct constraints and their optimal interfacing is a the center of many marketing speeches.
