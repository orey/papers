## Context

### A product is a set of components implementing functions implementing requirements

### Components at several levels

### The component embeds everything

### Use of those components in several contexts

### Variability level

Initial variability

Evolving variability: restructuring drawings

### Component and variability: impact on roles

Added value of the sub-contractors

### A need for digital product integration

Piloting the changes in interfaces is different 

Several levels of component compatibility

### The case of certified products

Management of changes must be done by components

Applicatibility is done at several levels

Keep an eye on the MSN

### Working in context at the component level

Description of the interfaces in multi-physics

Testing and validation at the component level

Testing and validation at the integration level

Automating the testing and validation

Accelerating convergence loops

### Manufacturing engineering at component level

The various levels of AL

Distributing the production sites

Determining intermediate levels of assemblies for production optimization

Optimization of sub-assemblies for sub-contracting

Validation of subcontractor deliveries (digital and physical)

Filtering mounting instructions by variability

Managing out of cycle and stock life-cycles

Retrofitting on stocks

Concurrent engineering

### Product support engineering

Product support analysis

Simulation per components / per product

Influencing design

The other branch of MBE => function based

Concurrent engineering

Linking with production

The PSA as the core of spares, docs, repair and training

Opening the door to follow the as-maintained

### Piloting a program from components

Thinking distribution of tasks and where are the activities

Urbanizing the activities/functions per site

Managing multiple interconnected plans

### The consequence on IT systems

Multiple distributed systems

Strong interfaces

Each business have its own way of seeing things

Sharing data and transforming the shared data

Interconnecting with suppliers

Interconnecting with customers for the in-service

A flexible set of digital tools
