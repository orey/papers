# MBSE vs EA

![Image illustrating architecture](../images/mbse-archi.jpg)

In the world of modeling, two streams evolve in parallel with some specific bridges: MBSE (model-based system engineering) and EA (enterprise architecture).

In this article, we will analyze the main differences of the two approaches, their common points and the various approaches that aim to fusion them in a single set of tools.

## MBSE/MBE

In manufacturing, the objective is to create products. The starting point of a product manufacturing is generally a set of requirements. To go from the requirements to the product is generally a long process involving the following phases:

  * Requirements engineering: The objective of this phase is to work on requirements in order to make them non ambiguous, to sort them by importance and to remove any inconsistency;
  * Functional analysis: This phase objective is to determine the functions of the product, the information flows and dependencies between functions; Generally, the functions are worked at different levels of granularity;
  * Logical system analysis: Once the various functions at various levels are known, the assignment of functions to logical elements can be done; The objective of those systems is to get the nearest possible from a possible industrial split of the product;
  * Physical design: Once the product has been split on several components, several teams can work in parallel on component design (at the level of granularity of the component); The product architecture will be a task at this level
