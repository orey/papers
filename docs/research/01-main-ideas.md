# Main ideas

All research projects are founded on main ideas. Here are the main ideas that are underlying to the GraphApps project.

 1. In the software engineering world, **our ways of representing knowledge are bad, inefficient and non evolutive**, being at the programmaning level or at the data level. This fact generates massive costs and pain in evolution of software or evolution of data storage. In one formula: Software is far from beware "soft".

 2. **Graphs enable better knowledge representation**, both static and within the evolution dynamics of programs and data. For instance, graphs can be used to address the technical debt problem (see [here](../graph/first-article.md) and [here](../graph/staf-icgt2018.md)) or to address complex data migration (see [here](../graph/data-migration.md)).

 3. **Graph transformations are at the heart of new software engineering paradigms**, such as graph-oriented programming (see [here](../graph/first-article.md) and [here](../graph/staf-icgt2018.md)) or semantic data migration (see [here](../graph/data-migration.md)). For sure, a new generation of tools is required to be efficient with those paradigms (design, programming languages, data storage).

 4. With a real evolutive software and data, **the total worldwide software effort could be divided by more than 2, probably 3**, which means:

    * An enormous worldwide gain of productivity;
    * A capability of evolving the business processes faster than ever before;
    * A convergence of the design processes of software creation, software evolution and refactoring;
    * A different midset based on graph representation of knowledge and graph transformations for business rules.

## Resources

### Technical debt

The well-known curve of software technical debt.

### Maintenance costs

The rule of 60/60:

  * Between 40% and 80% of software costs are maintenance costs (average 60%);
  * Around 60% of maintenance costs are enhancements.

### Complexity

"For every 10-percent increase in problem complexity, there is a 100-percent increase in the software solutions complexity."
