This article proposes a general model of interoperability between systems using the concept of [graph transformations](graph-transfo.md).

## Introduction

In the [real nature of data](../articles/data-interop.md), we discussed many important dimensions of data:

* Data can be considered as the "intersection" between the semantic domain and the point of view defined by the actor and the use case;
* Data are organized in a relative way, meaning that there are several ways to represent the same reality;
* Data is an "output product", result of a process and business rules that were applied before, and considering it as a "entry product" may lead to anti-scientific approaches (see the [article on artificial neural networks](about-ml.md)).
