## Main Ideas

All research projects are founded on main ideas. Here are the main ideas that are underlying to the GraphApps project.

**<u>Idea 1</u>:** In the software engineering world, **our ways of representing knowledge are bad, inefficient and non evolutive**, being at the programmaning level or at the data level. This fact generates massive costs and pain in evolution of software or evolution of data storage. In one formula: Software is far from beware "soft".

**<u>Idea 2</u>:** **Graphs enable better knowledge representation**, both static and within the evolution dynamics of programs and data. For instance, graphs can be used to address the technical debt problem (see [here](../graph/first-article.md) and [here](../graph/staf-icgt2018.md)) or to address complex data migration (see [here](../graph/data-migration.md)).

**<u>Idea 3</u>:** **Graph transformations are at the heart of new software engineering paradigms**, such as graph-oriented programming (see [here](../graph/first-article.md) and [here](../graph/staf-icgt2018.md)) or semantic data migration (see [here](../graph/data-migration.md)). For sure, a new generation of tools is required to be efficient with those paradigms (design, programming languages, data storage).

**<u>Idea 4</u>:** With a real evolutive software and data, **the total worldwide software effort could be divided by more than 2, probably 3**, which means:

    * An enormous worldwide gain of productivity;
    * A capability of evolving the business processes faster than ever before;
    * A convergence of the design processes of software creation, software evolution and refactoring;
    * A different mindset based on graph representation of knowledge and graph transformations for business rules.

## The Graph Transformations at the center

See the [Graph transformations](graph-transfo.md) page.

## Industrial Projects

2 main industrial projects were developed based on the 4 ideas and are implmeenting concepts described in the [graph transformation](graph-transfo.md) page:

  * [GraphApps project](graphapps.md) project (2013-2018)
  * [Semantic data migration project](data-mig.md) (2018-now)

## Open-source projects

Here is a list:

  * The [graph](https://github.com/orey/graph) repo: tests on graph transformations (Python project).
  * The [graphappsjs](https://github.com/orey/graphappsjs) repo, which is targeting the same objective but analyzes the link of the programming language in that problem (JS project).
  * The [csv2rdf](https://github.com/orey/csv2rdf) repo: able to turn a CSV file into RDF with a [graph transformation grammar](grammar-graph-transformation.md) (Python project).
  * The [rdfviz](https://github.com/orey/rdfviz) repo proposes to visualize rdf graph data (Python project).
  * The [ontovisu](https://github.com/orey/ontovisu) repo aims at enabling the neighborhood-based visual navigation in RDF graph data (JS project).
